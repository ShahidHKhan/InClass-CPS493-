About Me: Shahid Khan

I’m a junior CS major at SUNY New Paltz with a focus on full-stack development. I started out teaching myself web dev and deploying projects on Vercel for family and friends. A big turning point for me was leading a team at the New Paltz Hackathon; it really opened my eyes to the pressure of deadlines and how important it is to keep a team organized. I’ve also spent time at Google and other tech conferences to get a better feel for how the industry works at a high level.

While I love the engineering side, I’m actually aiming to become a Product Manager. I enjoy public speaking and want to be the person who connects engineers with customers. I’m taking this course to level up my skills in system diagrams and professional design patterns so I can move past the "self-taught" phase. My goal is to eventually lead dev teams with a solid technical background and a clear strategic vision.
