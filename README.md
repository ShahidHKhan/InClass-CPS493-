About Me: Shahid Khan

Computer Science Experience & Projects I am a junior Computer Science major at SUNY New Paltz with a growing background in full-stack development and team leadership. My technical journey began with self-taught web development, leading to several deployed projects for friends and family using Vercel. These projects served as my introduction to building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and managing the end-to-end deployment process. A pivotal moment in my experience was participating in the New Paltz Hackathon. Leading and organizing my group there taught me the realities of timely deployment, meeting rigorous standards under pressure, and the importance of high-level presentation. Beyond development, I’ve spent the last few years attending conferences from Google and other Big Tech companies to better understand the landscape of the modern tech industry.

Future Goals & Course Application While my foundation is in engineering, my ultimate career goal is to transition into Product Management. I aim to use my natural public speaking and organizational skills to serve as the "bridge" between engineers and customers. I believe that a truly great Product Manager must have a deep, technical grasp of software development and system architecture. In this course, I plan to move beyond self-teaching and master formal system diagrams and design patterns. I intend to apply these skills to create more sophisticated, better-structured full-stack projects. Ultimately, I am looking to gain a holistic view of the industry that will allow me to lead development teams with both technical authority and strategic vision.
